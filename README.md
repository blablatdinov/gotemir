Gotemir is a tool that verifies if the structure of the test directory mirrors the structure of the source code directory. It ensures that for every source file, a corresponding test file exists in the appropriate directory.

## Features

- Recursively scans both source and test directories.
- Verifies that every source file has a corresponding test file.
- Identifies missing test files and outputs results to the console.
